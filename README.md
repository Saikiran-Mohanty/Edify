Maintaing Attendace
For attendace system we used PHP and MySQL, We used Xampp server to record the database.
The teachers Email in the attendance form had to be sent twice, once for Submiting data and second time for publishing the value associated with that email.

Image To Text Conversion
We have used the OCR API from OCRSpace to convert image to txt which was placed in the compilor screen.
We Initially tried to buid our Own Compilor but weren't able to fix the bugs in such a short time period. Hence we tried to implement CodeX API to get a virtual compilor environment but later found
that the API was blocked. Due to time constraint we weren't able to build a fully working Virtual online Compilor, But we plan to implement it in our future scope.

Peer-to-Peer Communication SetUp
We made two separate Js files Sender.js and Receiver.js and connected it through Server.js using WebSocket. We took a demo using the same IP adredss of the server connecting it to the same  Wifi network.

WhiteBoard
We kept seaching for a good and effective WhiteBoard API for a long time, and were finally able to get one.

Apart from all this I Saikiran along with my friend Aatish are very happy as Developer Days gave us a great platform to learn and practice Web Development.
As a beginner we started and were finally able to develop what we thought.
